FINDING OUR PLACE IN VIRTUAL SPACE
FOPIVS

//Introduction

In our society, networked technologies are everywhere. Everyone is online all the time, through cell phones, computers, or even smart watches. In this digital age, I find myself feeling rather analog. By this I mean to say, I am aware of how much time I spend online, and I make a conscious decision to spend time offline. I read books and take notes on paper; I turn off my phone when I got to sleep; I turn off my computer when I don't plan on using it; My social media presence is quite low; I sketch out ideas for websites and other programming projects in physical sketchbooks before starting to work. Yet, even still, I am compelled to check my phone and my email on a regular basis, as if they control me, and not the other way around. For this reason, I decided to explore the ways in which we interact with technology in our daily lives.

Last December, after school had finished, I went to a bookstore looking to find books to inspire me and my work. What I left with was Douglas Rushkoff. His book, Program or Be Programmed, reaffirmed the way I had been interacting with my technological devices and social media, but took it further, putting science and reason behind concepts I had only felt intuitively. His latest book, Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now, is in essence a continuation of his previous writings. He discusses how living in the "eternal present" has affected us as a society, while still pushing ideas from Program or Be Programmed. Rushkoff helped me see these small actions as one cohesive idea, "whoever holds the keys to programming ends up building the reality in which the rest of us live." 

The fact that I spend most of my waking hours on the computer but am against the excessive use of social media are not two opposing practices at all. I do everything on the computer. Concept development and thinking I do offline, because I know the distractions of the internet will only lead to constant interruption of thought and therefore less structured ideas, but for everything after that stage, I am Computer Girl. The important thing, however, is that I do it all from scratch. I code. I am studying design and technology in order to design technology, not to design for technology as someone else makes it. I study design and technology to improve human interaction with our devices and therefore each other. I am here to create reality, not just to live in it. I am here to encourage others to do the same. (I am here to save the world.)


//Relation to Space/Place

As a society, we spend most – if not all – of our time connected to the internet. Our constant connection to virtual space is highly influential and formative to us as a species and our perception of reality. But the technologies we use are not necessarily designed in our best interest. Douglas Rushkoff gives an example in his books of asking a 9 year old child what Facebook is for. "It's for helping me make friends," the child replies – the response most people would give. That's not, however, what Facebook is for. Facebook exists to monetize friendship. Facebook exists to promote and to sell to groups of people with similar interests – friends. "If you don't know what the software is for, you're not using the software, you're a part of the software."

Everything is always in the present. We get emails, text messages and Facebook notifications in real time on our phones, all the time, at just about all hours of the day. These constant interruptions break us out of our natural biological rhythm. Our bodies naturally sync up to each other and to the world. Like marine animals whose mating cycles follow the patterns of the moon, we are a part of something bigger. Our internal clocks are ticking at a speed that's taken hundreds of thousands of years to develop. Attempting to break out of this pattern is futile; it's just bigger than us. In fact, it has visible negative effects on our bodies and therefore our happiness and productivity. So why do we allow this to continue when we have the technology to do the opposite? "Rather than trying to force our bodies to keep up with Moore's Law, we should design our technology to sync up with our own internal rhythms." 

We check our devices for new messages constantly. Most of them we know will be trash, not even worth our time, but we keep checking – waiting on that one message from that one person, or hoping the contents of one will spark a new idea, or solve the problem we're working on. But this isn't the case. People like to think they’re good at multi tasking, but statistically they’re not. When asked to perform more than one task at a time, performance decreases in both activities.
