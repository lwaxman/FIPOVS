                <h3><span class="blurryText">Laurie Waxman</span></h3>

                <span class="blurryText">In our society, networked technologies are everywhere. Everyone is online all the time, through cell phones, computers, or even smart watches. In this digital age, I find myself feeling rather analog. By this I mean to say, I am aware of how much time I spend online, and I make a conscious decision to spend time offline. I read books and take notes on paper; I turn off my phone when I got to sleep; I turn off my computer when I don't plan on using it; My social media presence is quite low; I sketch out ideas for websites and other programming projects in physical sketchbooks before starting to work. Yet, even still, I am compelled to check my phone and my email on a regular basis, as if they control me, and not the other way around. For this reason, I decided to explore the ways in which we interact with technology in our daily lives.<br></span>

                <span class="blurryText">Last December, after school had finished, I went to a bookstore looking to find books to inspire me and my work. What I left with was Douglas Rushkoff. His book, Program or Be Programmed, reaffirmed the way I had been interacting with my technological devices and social media, but took it further, putting science and reason behind concepts I had only felt intuitively. His latest book, Present Shock: When Everything Happens Now, is in essence a continuation of his previous writings. He discusses how living in the "eternal present" has affected us as a society, while still pushing ideas from Program or Be Programmed. Rushkoff helped me see these small actions as one cohesive idea, "whoever holds the keys to programming ends up building the reality in which the rest of us live." </br></span>

                <span class="blurryText">The fact that I spend most of my waking hours on the computer but am against the excessive use of social media are not two opposing practices at all. I do everything on the computer. Concept development and thinking I do offline, because I know the distractions of the internet will only lead to constant interruption of thought and therefore less structured ideas, but for everything after that stage, I am Computer Girl. The important thing, however, is that I do it all from scratch. I code. I am studying design and technology in order to design technology, not to design for technology as someone else makes it. I study design and technology to improve human interaction with our devices and therefore each other. I am here to create reality, not just to live in it. I am here to encourage others to do the same. (I am here to save the world.)</span>
